Behaviors that have been reduced in strength through extinction are said to be “extinguished.”"

  {
    term: "Prediction error",
    definition: "When the outcome of a conditioning trial is different from that which is predicted by the conditioned stimuli that are present on the trial (i.e., when the US is surprising). Prediction error is necessary to create Pavlovian conditioning (and associative learning generally). As learning occurs over repeated conditioning trials, the conditioned stimulus increasingly predicts the unconditioned stimulus, and prediction error declines. Conditioning works to correct or reduce prediction error."
  },
  {
    term: "Preparedness",
    definition: "The idea that an organism’s evolutionary history can make it easy to learn a particular association. Because of preparedness, you are more likely to associate the taste of tequila, and not the circumstances surrounding drinking it, with getting sick. Similarly, humans are more likely to associate images of spiders and snakes than flowers and mushrooms with aversive outcomes like shocks."

  {
    term: "Punisher",
    definition: "A stimulus that decreases the strength of an operant behavior when it is made a consequence of the behavior."
  },
  {
    term: "Quantitative law of effect",
    definition: "A mathematical rule that states that the effectiveness of a reinforcer at strengthening an operant response depends on the amount of reinforcement earned for all alternative behaviors. A reinforcer is less effective if there is a lot of reinforcement in the environment for other behaviors."
  },
  {
    term: "Reinforcer",
    definition: "Any consequence of a behavior that strengthens the behavior or increases the likelihood that it will be performed it again."

  },
  {
    term: "Renewal effect",
    definition: "Recovery of an extinguished response that occurs when the context is changed after extinction.
